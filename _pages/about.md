My fascination with Tech began at a young age. Some of my earliest memories are taking apart the family playstation and practicing soldering on various electronics. Since then my passion for technology has never faded. In high school I worked in the repair center on Apple MacBooks. Later, I graduated from CSU Pueblo with a bachelors in Computer Information Systems. Currently, I am set to graduate with a Masters in Computer Information Systems in Fall of 2024 from CSU Fort Collins.

I have 5+ year of experience working in data analytics and business intelligence. Additionally, I have many more years of experience working in various fields such as cyber security, programming, and electronics repair. I gained these skills through various volunteer and independent projects.

Everyday, I strive to experience and learn more, with the hope that my skills can make a positive impact on the world.
